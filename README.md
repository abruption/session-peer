Message **Claude Code and Codex sessions**, locally or over SSH, from one CLI.
Claude targets use their native inbox socket/pipe; Codex targets use `codex queue`.
SSH runs the same Python script on the destination, so session-peer need not be
installed there to receive a send or list request.

This project continues cc-peer with its Git history and issue numbers preserved.
session-peer releases are published on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/session-peer/)
and [GitHub](https://github.com/abruption/session-peer/releases); the old PyPI
cc-peer project is archived after its final 0.5.1 release.
See [Moving from cc-peer](#moving-from-cc-peer) for explicit migration steps.

## Quick start

Install the CLI with `pipx install session-peer` or `uv tool install session-peer`.
For the standalone CLI plus Claude skill, see [Install](#install).

```bash
session-peer list                              # Claude sessions (default)
session-peer list --agent claude                # explicit equivalent
session-peer list --agent codex                 # saved Codex threads
session-peer list --agent codex --host worker   # saved threads on an SSH host

session-peer send --to api-worker "message"     # Claude name or PID
session-peer send --to 'codex:<full-thread-uuid>' "message"
session-peer send --host worker --to 'codex:<full-thread-uuid>' --dry-run "message"
```

Replace `<full-thread-uuid>` with a full ID from the destination's Codex listing.
`list` selects one agent at a time; it does not merge both agents. **Use
`--agent codex`, not `--codex`**: `--codex` is not a supported flag and is ambiguous
with `--codex-home` and `--codex-bin`. `send` selects the agent from its target,
not a `--agent` flag.

**Posted/queued is not acknowledged.** Saved Codex threads are not necessarily
running, and session-peer does not wake/resume a session or wait for its reply.

## Install

Python 3.9+, standard library only — no external dependencies.

### pip

In an activated virtual environment:

```bash
python -m pip install session-peer
```

Or with [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/) for an isolated install:

```bash
pipx install session-peer
```

Alternatively, use `uv tool install session-peer`.
Package managers install the `session-peer` command but not the [Claude Code skill](#the-skill).
To add the skill so Claude can use session-peer on its own:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/session-peer
curl -fsSL -o ~/.claude/skills/session-peer/SKILL.md \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abruption/session-peer/main/skills/session-peer/SKILL.md
```

### install.sh

Installs both the command and the skill in one step. Use this for air-gapped
hosts or remote deployment over SSH:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abruption/session-peer && cd session-peer

./install.sh                          # this machine
./install.sh --host build-server      # a remote machine, over SSH
./install.sh --host web-01 --host db  # several at once
```

That places `session_peer.py` in `~/.local/share/session-peer/`, installs the
[Claude Code skill](skills/session-peer/SKILL.md) in `~/.claude/skills/session-peer/`,
and links `~/.local/bin/session-peer`. Existing cc-peer files are preserved.
Remove it with `./install.sh --uninstall [--host ...]`.

`session-peer update` refreshes a standalone program from the latest GitHub release.
`./install.sh --host <host>` pushes this checkout's program and skill over SSH.
`session-peer update --host <host>` pushes only the program when the installed
version differs or is absent; add `--check` to report without changing anything.
See [Updating](#updating) for package-managed installs and remote limitations.

**Remote installs push the files over the SSH connection itself**, so the target needs
no internet access. Installing the standalone files requires `python3` and SSH
access. Messaging also requires the selected agent's native inbox or queue on
the destination.

Or skip the installer entirely and copy the one file:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abruption/session-peer/main/session_peer.py
chmod +x session_peer.py
```

### The skill

The standalone installer puts the program in `~/.local/share/session-peer/`
and the skill separately in `~/.claude/skills/session-peer/SKILL.md`. Skill placement
respects `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, then `ANTHROPIC_CONFIG_DIR`, before the default.
The skill guides Claude's choice of target and message; the Python program
performs discovery and transport. Installing it does not install a Codex
plugin or change either agent's permissions or inbound settings.

## Usage

```bash
session-peer list                                  # Claude sessions on this machine
session-peer list --host web-01                    # Claude sessions over there
session-peer list --host web-01 --all              # Claude stale records / no inbox
session-peer list --agent codex --all              # include archived Codex threads

session-peer send --to api-worker "message"        # local session
session-peer send --host web-01 --to api-worker "message"
session-peer send --host web-01 --to 4011 "message"          # address by pid
git log --oneline -5 | session-peer send --host web-01 --to api-worker -   # stdin

session-peer send --host web-01 --to api-worker --dry-run "x"   # resolve only
session-peer list --host web-01 --json             # machine-readable

session-peer send --host web-01 --ssh-opt=-p --ssh-opt=2222 --to api-worker "..."   # note the '='

# Envelope. Sends identify the Claude/Codex sender and how to answer when the
# current agent session and a return route can be detected.
session-peer send --host web-01 --to api-worker --no-reply-to "..."         # no return address
session-peer send --host web-01 --to api-worker --no-from "..."             # no From: header
session-peer send --host web-01 --to api-worker --reply-to 100.64.0.5 "..." # state the address
```

Inside an agent session, the default envelope identifies the sender explicitly:

```text
From: codex:01a08dd6-d3f6-7783-a62b-52c1fd049181 @ abruptly@mac-mini-m4.example.ts.net

message

---
Reply: python3 /path/to/session_peer.py send --host abruptly@mac-mini-m4.example.ts.net --to codex:01a08dd6-d3f6-7783-a62b-52c1fd049181 --no-reply-to
```

Claude senders use `claude:<session-name>` in the same positions. The identity is
best-effort text derived from the current process environment; it is not an
authentication claim. A plain shell has no agent identity to advertise.

Repeat `--host` to operate on several SSH destinations. `--json` is available on
`list`, `send`, and `update`; v0.6 retains command-specific response shapes rather
than a uniform envelope. See [#29](https://github.com/abruption/session-peer/issues/29).

When local `tailscale status --json` identifies a `--host` by device hostname,
short MagicDNS name, full MagicDNS name, or Tailscale IP, session-peer verifies and
reports the current MagicDNS FQDN as `host`. SSH still receives the supplied value
as its destination alias, reported separately as `sshHost` when different, while a
`HostName` override routes the connection to that FQDN and `HostKeyAlias` retains
the existing host-key lookup. This preserves matching `Host`, `User`, `Port`, and
`IdentityFile` settings. A known peer reported offline fails before SSH. Hosts
absent from the tailnet map remain normal SSH destinations.

Exit codes: `0` successful command (including listing or dry-run), `1` operational
error, `2` CLI usage error or an unresolved target reported as no-target, and
`130` interrupted (Ctrl-C). A Codex queue rejection, including a missing rollout,
is an operational error (`1`); a missing saved thread during dry-run returns `2`.
Exit `0` on send does not confirm consumption or a reply.

### Updating

For package-managed installs, use the same manager that installed the command:

```bash
pipx upgrade session-peer
# or: uv tool upgrade session-peer
# or, in its virtual environment: python -m pip install --upgrade session-peer
```

For these installs, local `session-peer update` (including `--check`) prints
package-manager guidance without checking GitHub or replacing the package's files.

For standalone programs:

```bash
session-peer update --check                       # check the latest GitHub release
session-peer update                               # update the local program
session-peer update --host web-01 --check         # inspect the remote standalone copy
session-peer update --host web-01                 # push this program if versions differ
```

Remote update compares against the **local program's version**, not the latest
GitHub release. It pushes even if the remote version is newer; check first and
update the local program before distributing it. The remote copy does not fetch
from GitHub. Remote version probes inspect only
`~/.local/share/session-peer/session_peer.py`, not pip/pipx/uv installations;
remote update installs that standalone path and its CLI link. For a
package-managed remote CLI, upgrade it with its own manager on that host instead.

Neither local nor remote `update` refreshes the Claude skill. Re-run `install.sh`
from the desired release checkout to refresh both standalone program and skill.

### Environment variables

| Variable | Effect |
| :-- | :-- |
| `SESSION_PEER_REPLY_HOST` | Override the advertised reply host: `--reply-to` → `SESSION_PEER_REPLY_HOST` → `CC_PEER_REPLY_HOST` → auto-detected Tailscale MagicDNS name or IP. A detectable Claude or Codex sender session is still required for a reply line. |
| `CC_PEER_REPLY_HOST` | Legacy fallback; prefer `SESSION_PEER_REPLY_HOST` for new configuration. |
| `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` | Where Claude Code keeps its config (default `~/.claude`). Respected by `session-peer list` for session discovery and by `install.sh` for skill placement. |
| `ANTHROPIC_CONFIG_DIR` | Fallback if `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` is unset. |
| `CODEX_HOME` | Codex discovery/queue home (default `~/.codex`); overridden by `--codex-home`. |
| `SESSION_PEER_CODEX_HOMES` | Additional destination homes to check for duplicate thread UUIDs before an implicit send/dry-run. JSON array of absolute paths (or `~/…`), not a shell command or a path-separated list. It does not change the selected home or merge listings. |

With `--host`, discovery uses the destination's environment; local environment
variables are not automatically forwarded. `--codex-home` and `--codex-bin`
explicitly select paths on that destination.

## Codex sessions

Codex discovery reads `state_5.sqlite` using a read-only SQLite connection.
This internal schema is experimental, tested with Codex CLI 0.154.0 on macOS;
cross-platform fixture tests are not a claim of live Codex verification on all OSes.
Saved sessions are not necessarily active. `--all` includes archived threads.

`--codex-home` overrides the destination's `CODEX_HOME` (default `~/.codex`).
`--codex-bin` overrides its PATH lookup of `codex` for sending. On SSH these are
remote paths. Sending requires a Codex executable with the `queue` command and
the appropriate saved thread/rollout in that home; a listing alone does not
prove the queue can accept it.

### Orca and multiple Codex homes

An Orca-launched session can use a per-account home while a separate terminal
or SSH command uses `~/.codex`. The same UUID can exist in both. A successful
queue submission to one copy does not establish that the intended session is
using that home.

Use the **same explicit destination home for list and send**. For example, replace
`<account-id>` and `<full-thread-uuid>` with the intended account and thread:

```bash
session-peer list --host mac --agent codex \
  --codex-home '~/Library/Application Support/orca/codex-accounts/<account-id>/home' --json
session-peer send --host mac --to 'codex:<full-thread-uuid>' \
  --codex-home '~/Library/Application Support/orca/codex-accounts/<account-id>/home' \
  --dry-run --json "message"
```

Omit `--host mac` for local use. Remove `--dry-run` only when ready to submit.
Quoting `~` keeps expansion on the destination; an absolute remote path also
works. `--codex-home` explicitly chooses that copy but is not proof of activity.
This explicit-home workaround also works with the published 0.6.0 package.

The #55 safeguards described below ship in v0.6.1; the original PyPI 0.6.0
package does not check other homes or expose the new JSON fields.

Without `--codex-home`, selection still uses destination `CODEX_HOME`, then
`~/.codex`. Before send or dry-run, the ambiguity guard checks a bounded inventory:

- The selected home and the default `~/.codex` when its state DB exists.
- On macOS only, existing state DBs immediately under
  `~/Library/Application Support/orca/codex-accounts/*/home`.
- Additional homes from destination `SESSION_PEER_CODEX_HOMES`, for example:

```bash
export SESSION_PEER_CODEX_HOMES='["/srv/codex/account-a", "/srv/codex/account-b"]'
```

Configure this in the destination command's environment; a local export is not
forwarded by `--host`. On Windows, use absolute Windows paths with backslashes
escaped as required by JSON. Empty configuration arrays are allowed; malformed
configuration is an error for implicit sends.

If the UUID occurs in multiple known homes, the command fails before queueing
and names the candidates. Archived copies count too. During multi-home checks,
unreadable or incompatible known databases and missing configured additional
databases prevent implicit submission; an unreadable Orca inventory also blocks it. Choose
`--codex-home` explicitly to bypass the ambiguity guard and unrelated inventory
errors. Resolved symlink aliases and repeated paths count as one home.

The guard never automatically switches to another home. With no competing
home, native queue behavior is preserved; `list` still reads only the selected
home, so a successful listing is not an ambiguity check. There is no general
filesystem scan, process-environment inspection, activity detection or atomic
cross-home snapshot. Unconfigured/custom layouts and copies created after the
check can be missed. For Orca layouts other than the macOS path above, configure
the additional homes or use `--codex-home`. Further diagnostics belong to [#45](https://github.com/abruption/session-peer/issues/45).

### Submission and JSON results

Submission uses `codex queue`, never direct database writes. `queued` means the
CLI accepted the submission, not that a turn consumed it or acknowledged it.
session-peer does not wake or resume sessions. Queue DB writes and Claude socket
connections may require approval in the caller's execution environment; the tool
does not change sandbox or inbound policies. A queue timeout (30 seconds) has an
unknown submission outcome: inspect the destination before retrying. It is not
a timeout for waiting on a reply, and session-peer does not automatically retry.

Codex messages are limited to 32 KiB of UTF-8 including sender/reply headers, as a
session-peer portability policy rather than a measured Codex server limit. NUL
characters cannot be passed as CLI arguments. `--dry-run` verifies the executable
and saved target without queueing but cannot guarantee a later submission will succeed.

Local Codex list JSON retains `sessions` and `version`, and adds the resolved
absolute `codexHome` at the top level. Each entry has
`agent`, `id`, `name` (first line, at most 120 characters), `cwd`, `updatedAt`
(Unix seconds), and `archived`. Remote list JSON is an array of per-host results,
even for one host; each successful result includes `host`, `sessions`, `version`, `codexHome`
and an optional `remoteVersion` for an installed standalone copy.

Codex send JSON retains `target: {agent, id}`, `status: queued` (or `validated`
under dry-run), `ok`, `chars`, `dryRun`, and optional `queueId`. It adds:

- `codexHome`: the resolved absolute destination home, not a sender-side guess.
- `submitted`: `true` only after successful queue CLI completion, `false` for dry-run.
- `consumptionConfirmed`: always `false`; neither queued nor validated establishes consumption.

Errors keep the existing `{ok: false, error}` shape (plus host on remote results).
A timeout has an unknown submission outcome; missing `submitted` on an error
must not be interpreted as proof that nothing was queued. Listing results do
not describe a submission and have no submission/consumption fields. The changes
are additive, not the cross-command envelope redesign tracked in [#29](https://github.com/abruption/session-peer/issues/29).

A remote send to one host returns a flat object with `host`; multiple hosts return an array.
Claude output stays compatible. When `CODEX_THREAD_ID` (or the compatibility
fallback `CODEX_SESSION_ID`) is present, the message envelope and reply command
identify the originating Codex thread.

`doctor`, reply waiting/`--wait`, structured reply URIs and optional wake are
future work, not v0.6 features: see the [v0.7](https://github.com/abruption/session-peer/issues/45)
and [v0.8](https://github.com/abruption/session-peer/issues/46) roadmaps.

## Moving from cc-peer

The repository rename and package transition are complete:
[session-peer 0.6.0](https://pypi.org/project/session-peer/0.6.0/) is published and
[cc-peer 0.5.1](https://pypi.org/project/cc-peer/0.5.1/) is the final Claude-only
compatibility release. **The old PyPI cc-peer project is archived; the GitHub
session-peer repository remains active.** Existing legacy distributions remain
downloadable and are not yanked for migration. See the completed [transition
issue #48](https://github.com/abruption/session-peer/issues/48).

Install the new product explicitly with `pipx install session-peer`,
`uv tool install session-peer`, or the [standalone installer](#installsh).
No `cc-peer` command alias is installed. Both products can coexist.
After checking your workflows, remove the old package with the same manager that
installed it, e.g. `pipx uninstall cc-peer`. For a script installation, use the
`install.sh --uninstall` from the pinned cc-peer v0.5.1 tag; check its paths and
back up local customizations before running it. New uninstall only removes
session-peer files.

Update scripts and agent instructions to call `session-peer` and use the new
standalone program path `~/.local/share/session-peer/session_peer.py`, not the old
`~/.claude/skills/cc-peer/cc_peer.py`. The new Claude skill lives separately in
`~/.claude/skills/session-peer/`. Claude/Codex configuration, session data and old
installations are not migrated or removed automatically. Replace
`CC_PEER_REPLY_HOST` with `SESSION_PEER_REPLY_HOST` when convenient; the old
variable remains a fallback.

The final cc-peer release is not an ongoing feature or security-maintenance
promise. The frozen root `cc_peer.py` is retained in tags for old self-update
URLs but is excluded from the new wheel and sdist. Its local update command
directs users here instead of installing a different product.

## Claude Code sessions

### Use the official feature first

For Claude-to-Claude workflows, consider Claude Code's built-in
[cross-session messaging](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/cross-session-messaging)
and [Remote Control](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/remote-control) first.
session-peer provides a shell-driven local/SSH path when that workflow is not
available or suitable, and a common CLI for Claude and Codex targets. The
Claude-specific guidance in this section is not a prerequisite for Codex queues.

### How the inbox transport works

Claude Code's [session inbox socket](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/cross-session-messaging#the-sessions-inbox-socket)
accepts a JSON line:

```json
{"type":"user","message":{"role":"user","content":"your message"}}
```

session-peer connects on the machine that owns that inbox. For SSH sends, it
pipes its source to remote `python3 -` and makes the connection there, rather
than forwarding the Unix socket. Native Windows targets use a named pipe and
the auth line from the session's `.key` file instead.

Session records normally live in `~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json` and carry the
socket path in `messagingSocketPath`. Never guess `/tmp/cc-socks/`: previous
tests found both that layout and `/run/user/1001/cc-socks/`. A live PID without
a bound inbox is treated as unreachable. The record schema is an internal
interface and may change; use `session-peer list --all` to inspect stale or
inbox-less records. A record or socket's existence does not guarantee that the
caller has permission to write to it.

### The receiving side decides what happens next

**"Posted" is not "delivered."** Writing to the socket succeeds; whether Claude ever reads the message is up to that session's [inbound controls](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/cross-session-messaging#control-inbound-messages).

Messages can be held for approval or refused. In the legacy verification, a
bypass-mode receiver held script-originated messages until approved. Do not
infer receipt from a successful socket write or change permission modes to
make a test pass.

If you deliberately want a worker to accept incoming messages unattended,
configure that receiver explicitly:

```json
{ "crossSessionInbound": "accept" }
```

Scope this with project settings or `--settings` if it is intended for one worker;
user settings affect other sessions for that OS user too. Accepting messages can
start receiving turns and consume usage. session-peer never applies this setting
for you, and the receiver's own tool permissions still apply.

### Why not `tmux send-keys`?

Terminal keystrokes can land in a running subprocess or permission prompt, not
the intended chat input. session-peer uses the agent's inbox/queue boundary
instead. Claude treats an inbox message as peer text, subject to its
[receiving-session rules](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/cross-session-messaging#how-a-session-treats-an-incoming-message),
not as the user typing approval.

## Limits

- **Sender identity is best-effort.** When running inside a detectable Claude or
  Codex session, session-peer adds an agent-qualified textual `From:` header.
  Outside that context, it may omit it. This is not an authenticated identity
  protocol; environment variables and session registries are local hints.
- **Advertised replies need a working return path.** When an agent sender and
  reply host can be determined, a `Reply:` line supplies an SSH return command.
  Forward SSH success does not prove reverse SSH access. v0.6 does not verify
  that route, correlate a reply, or wait for one; the address grants no access.
- **Tailscale status is a local routing hint.** A known online peer is addressed
  by its current MagicDNS name and a known offline peer is rejected before SSH.
  An unknown destination remains ordinary SSH; session-peer does not claim that
  every SSH host belongs to the tailnet.
- **No discovery across a bastion.** `--host` is a single SSH hop; chain it yourself with an SSH config `ProxyJump`.
- **Destination user and execution permissions matter.** Claude inboxes and
  Codex state/queues belong to the destination account. Use the correct account
  and home; a caller's sandbox may still deny access. session-peer does not
  bypass either agent's permissions or quota.
- **`--host` and `--ssh-opt` are as trusted as your ssh config.** They are handed to `ssh`, so whoever controls them controls where you connect. Values that would make ssh run a local command (`ProxyCommand` and friends) are refused, and a `--host` starting with `-` is rejected outright — but if you allowlist `session-peer` for an agent, treat it as granting SSH, not just messaging. Message bodies and session names carry no such risk: they are quoted before they reach any shell.
- **Windows support.** Claude's named pipe transport is supported.
  `install.sh` and the standalone remote installer/updater use POSIX shell;
  use a Python package manager on native Windows. Live Codex verification
  for v0.6 was on macOS, not Windows.

## Tests

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

The suite needs no live agent, SSH server or network. It includes legacy
compatibility tests, shared CLI helpers, fixture-based Codex discovery and queue
subprocess tests, and isolated standalone installation/coexistence checks.
Codex coverage includes argv/payload handling, destination home selection,
dry-run without dispatch, failure/timeout semantics and remote option forwarding.
Multi-home fixtures reproduce duplicate UUIDs across the default and Orca/configured
homes, fail-closed inventory errors, explicit selection, alias deduplication,
single-home compatibility and home/submission metadata. They never infer a live
writer from a saved row or submit messages to real sessions.

CI runs tests on Ubuntu/macOS with Python 3.9 and 3.13, and Windows with Python
3.13 (POSIX installer tests are skipped there). Separate jobs check shell syntax
with `shellcheck`, standalone install/reinstall/uninstall, and wheel/sdist
contents and installation. This is not full transport coverage: Claude discovery
fixtures, real UDS payload checks and broader exit-code/remote-command regression
tests remain tracked in [#28](https://github.com/abruption/session-peer/issues/28).

## Verified

### session-peer v0.6.1 (2026-09-15)

- 174 local tests and the release CI checks passed after integrating the v0.6.0
  Codex adapter with duplicate-home protection, sender-agent envelopes, and
  MagicDNS SSH routing. Wheel/sdist builds and isolated installs were checked.
- A local Codex listing and explicit-home dry-run succeeded without submission.
  A read-only SSH listing supplied by Tailscale IP connected through the current
  MagicDNS `HostName` and retained the original value as `sshHost`/`HostKeyAlias`.
- No live message was submitted as part of release preparation. Queue acceptance,
  message consumption, acknowledgements, and reverse SSH reachability remain
  distinct outcomes.

### session-peer v0.6.0 transition (2026-09-10)

- 134 local tests and the release CI checks passed. Wheel/sdist builds and
  isolated installs, actual PyPI installs, package-manager update protection,
  and coexistence/removal of the legacy CLI were checked.
- With Codex CLI **0.154.0 on two macOS machines**, local/SSH saved-session
  discovery, dry-run and actual queue submission worked. The submitted bodies
  matched the queue records. Those checks established **queued**, not consumed
  or acknowledged, and did not establish a reliable active-session indicator.
- Claude local/SSH inbox writes through the new CLI succeeded. A weekly usage
  limit prevented fresh receiving-turn/reply verification; those writes are
  not claimed as completed round trips.
- Standalone CLI/Claude skill migration was checked on two macOS hosts and two
  Ubuntu hosts. Installation and read-only discovery checks did not start agent
  turns or change inbound settings.

See [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md) and [#48](https://github.com/abruption/session-peer/issues/48)
for the release sequence and verification limits.

### Historical cc-peer Claude transport verification

Before the rename, Claude Code **v2.1.263** was exercised across five machines
over SSH on a Tailscale network: two macOS 26 (Apple silicon), two Ubuntu 24.04
(arm64, Oracle Ampere A1 in separate regions), and one Windows 10 22H2.
These historical observations are not a claim that every test was repeated
with session-peer v0.6.0:

- Posting from macOS to Linux sessions in two regions; each landed in the receiving transcript as
  `type: user` with `origin.kind: "peer"`.
- Payload integrity — quotes, backticks, `$HOME`, and emoji arrive byte-for-byte.
- The held path: a bypass-mode session raised an approval dialog, then logged
  `Released 1 held cross-session message` once approved.
- Both socket layouts in the wild: `/tmp/cc-socks/` on one Ubuntu host, `/run/user/1001/cc-socks/`
  on another running the same build.
- Windows named pipe transport (`\\.\pipe\LOCAL\cc-msg-<hash>`) with mandatory auth line read from
  the session's `.key` file. `list`, `send`, and `--host` all verified on the Windows machine.

Both agents' discovery formats can change between upstream releases. A previous
successful transport test does not guarantee discovery or delivery in a newer
agent build.
